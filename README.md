# PyMetAnalyzer: Python Library for Metagenomics

## Description

PyMetAnalyzer is a Python library designed explicitly for metagenomic research. It offers integrated tools for read simulation, k-mer calculation, and interaction with NCBI bacterial sequence databases. This library was crafted to facilitate the analysis of metagenomic data, allowing researchers to focus on their research without worrying about the technical aspects of data processing.

## Features

PyMetAnalyzer consists of several modules, each dedicated to a specific task within the metagenomic workflow:

### Read Simulation Module
- Interaction with reads simulators like ART or Grinder.
- Customizable functions to set simulation parameters, including read length, error rate, and taxonomic profiles.

### k-mer Analysis Module
- Tools for efficient calculation and analysis of k-mers in DNA sequences.
- Integration of existing algorithms and development of new methods for k-mer analysis and other relevant genomic metrics.

### NCBI Database Interaction Module
- Features for downloading and processing genomic data directly from the NCBI database.
- Efficient management of large data volumes and optimized local storage options.

### Data Preprocessing Module
- The data Preprocessing Module consists of tools for data cleaning, normalization, and dimensionality reduction of metagenomic data sets.

### Machine Learning Module
- Integration of classification and regression models for metagenomic analysis.
- Tools for training, optimizing, and validating machine learning models.

### Data Visualization and Analysis Module
- Advanced tools for graphical data visualization and results.
- Features for detailed analysis of the importance and contribution of genomic features.

### User Interface and Documentation
- An intuitive interface for easy access and interaction with the library.
- Comprehensive documentation, including practical examples and usage guides.

## Installation

PyMetAnalyzer is easily installed via pip:

```bash
pip install pymetanalyzer
```
  
```python
import pymetanalyzer as pma

# Ejemplo de uso de m칩dulo de simulaci칩n de reads
sim_reads = pma.read_simulator(params)

# Ejemplo de c치lculo de k-mers
kmer_results = pma.kmer_analysis(sequence_data)

# Ejemplo de interacci칩n con base de datos NCBI
ncbi_data = pma.ncbi_interaction(query_params)

```
